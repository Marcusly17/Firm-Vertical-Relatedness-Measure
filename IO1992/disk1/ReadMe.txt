Description of data

This diskette contains data from the 1992 benchmark 
input-output (I-O) accounts as published in "Input-Output
Accounts of the U.S. Economy, 1992," SURVEY OF CURRENT 
BUSINESS 78  (November 1997). Reprints of the article are
available from the above address at a cost of $25.

Methodology, coverage of data, and data definitions are 
noted in the SURVEY article describing the benchmark I-O.

Data files containing the tables are fixed format ASCII files
consisting of a row I-O code, a column I-O code, the table
reference number, and the cell value(s).  Values represent
millions of dollars in producers' prices.  All values are 
right justified with decimals shown explicitly.  All cells in
the tables are included.  No copyrighted data are found in 
these files.

Table 2.--The Use of Commodities by Industries, includes the 
data found in SURVEY tables 2.1 and 2.2, and transportation costs
and margins for each transaction.

The data files have been compressed as self-extracting 
executable files.  Approximate disk space required for 
the uncompressed files is:

            IOMake.txt     -- 4.6 megabytes
            IOUse.txt      -- 9.6 megabytes
            CxIDR.txt      -- 5.3 megabytes

Procedure for using disk

Copy all diskette files to a directory on your hard disk.  
At the DOS prompt, type name of the table you want to see,
for example IOMake, this will decompress the data and create
a comma delimited ASCII text file, to continue the example 
above IOMake.txt. (Windows 95 or NT users should click on
Start, then select Run, then type (or browse and select)the
directory path you created for the diskette data, e.g.;
"C:\IOData\IOMake.exe")

A program has been included to extract data from the text
files.  Please refer to IOXTRACT.DOC for instructions.
