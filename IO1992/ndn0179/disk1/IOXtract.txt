                          IOXTRACT.EXE DOCUMENTATION

OVERVIEW

IOXTRACT is a program which allows users to extract rows and columns
from the 1992 benchmark make (SICMake.txt) and use (SICUse.txt) tables.

OPERATION

IOXTRACT reads 2-6 digit input-output (I-O) row and column codes from a
user-created file and then extracts records containing these codes from
the data table.  The row and column codes represent commodities or
industries.  Messages are written to screen when a record is extracted.

The extracted data table records are written to the file IO-OUT.DAT.
IO-OUT.DAT is rewritten each time the program is run.  Rename this
file if you wish to save the results from the previous run.

The record count per I-O code extracted is written to screen at the end
of the program.  The total for all records extracted is also provided.

The files containing the I-O codes and data table are entered on the
command line.

SAMPLE COMMAND LINE OPERATION:

      I-O codes file:   iocodes
      Make table file:  SICMake.txt
      Command line:     ioxtract iocodes sicmake.txt

      I-O codes file:  iocodes2
      Use table file:  iouse.txt
      Command line:    ioxtract iocodes2 iouse.txt

FORMAT OF THE I-O CODES FILE

Users create the I-O codes file.  The file must be an ASCII (PRN) file.
ASCII files can be created using text editors, such as the DOS
editor--EDIT.  The file layout table for the I-O codes file follows.

      ---------------------------------------------------
             Field               Format        Position
      ---------------------------------------------------
      Row/Column designator        A1             1
      I-O Code                      I            2-7
      ----------------------------------------------------
      A1: alphanumeric, length 1;   I: integer

The row/column designator signifies whether the following I-O code is
a row or column.  Valid row designators are: 'r' and 'R'.  Valid column
designators are: 'c' and 'C'.

Row codes in the use and direct requirements tables represent
commodities and column codes represent industries.  Row codes in the
make table represent industries and column codes represent commodities.

The I-O code is a two to six digit numeric code specifying which I-O
rows or columns are to be extracted.  The fully specified code is six
digit.  Less than 6 digit codes extract all codes beginning with the
digits specified;  e.g., 0101 would extract 010101, 010102, 010103, etc.

SAMPLE I-O CODES FILE

r010100                  -- extracts row 010100
c05                      -- extracts any column beginning with 05
R070                     -- extracts any row beginning with 070
C910000                  -- extracts column 910000

I-O CODES FILE ERROR MESSAGES

The program checks the entries in the I-O codes file for some errors,
such as invalid row/column designators and non-numeric I-O codes.  If a
bad row/column designator or I-O code is found, the error message and
bad code is written to screen and the file--BADCODES.   Because the
program continues, even if some bad codes are found, look at the
BADCODES file after every run.

The error checking DOES NOT find codes which are syntactically correct,
but invalid.  For example, use table I-O code r999999 is syntactically
correct, but is not a valid I-O code.  Use table I-O row codes begin at
010100 and end at 900000.

The SIC-IO.txt file contains I-O codes with descriptions.  Expand (if
necessary) to 6 digits and eliminate the period, to convert these codes
to the I-O codes required by IOXTRACT.  For example, SIC-IO code 1.0100
is IOXTRACT code 010100, SIC-IO code 11.0601 is IOXTRACT code 110601,
etc.

SPEED

This program performs a sequential (record by record) search through
the entire data table file when searching for rows or columns.
Sequential searches are slow.  A Pentium PC is recommended.
